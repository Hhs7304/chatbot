# 🤖 AI Chatbot

Welcome to the **AI Chatbot** project! This chatbot is designed to understand user intents and generate responses accordingly. It's built using **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

## 🚀 Features

- **Intent Recognition**: Classifies user inputs into various intents like greetings, farewells, queries, etc.
- **Custom Responses**: Provides dynamic responses based on identified intents.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to extend for additional intents and responses.
- **NLP Preprocessing**: Tokenization, padding, and label encoding to process natural language.

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-chatbot.git
cd ai-chatbot


### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

bash
# For Python virtualenv
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`


### 3. Install Dependencies

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

---

## 🔧 Training the Model

To train the chatbot model, run the following command:

bash
python intent_model.py
```

- **Model Saving**: The trained model is saved as `intent_model.h5`.
- **Tokenizer & Label Encoder**: These are saved as `tokenizer.pickle` and `label_encoder.pickle`.

---

## 🤖 Running the Chatbot

Once the model is trained, you can start the chatbot by running:

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

### Example Conversation:
```
Chatbot: Hello! How can I help you today?
You: Hi
Chatbot: Hello!
You: Goodbye
Chatbot: See you later!
```

## 📂 Project Structure


.
├── chatbot.py          # Main script for running the chatbot
├── intent_model.py     # Script for training the intent recognition model
├── response_generation.py  # Intent-based response generation
├── preprocessing.py    # Text preprocessing utilities
├── model/              # Saved model and tokenizer files
├── README.md           # Project README file
└── requirements.txt    # Required Python libraries


## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Preprocessing**: The input text is cleaned, tokenized, and padded.
2. **Intent Recognition**: The trained LSTM model predicts the user’s intent.
3. **Response Generation**: The chatbot generates responses based on the predicted intent.
